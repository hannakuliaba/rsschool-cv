## Code
Student's Final Grade Kata from Codewars: Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects. This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades: 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10; 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5; 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2; 0, in other cases.

```
function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if (exam > 90 || projects > 10) {
    return 100;
  } else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5) {
    return 90;
  } else if (exam > 50 && projects >= 2) {
